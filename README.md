1. Git clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/abhraneeldhar7/lazy-ping.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. Create a Supabase account and create a new project
4. Create a `.env` file and add your Supabase credentials
5. Run the application: `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`

## üìà GitHub Actions

The project uses a GitHub Actions workflow to ping an endpoint every 10 minutes. The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/ping.yml`.

```yml
name: Ping Endpoint

on:
  schedule:
    - cron:  */10 * * * *

jobs:
  ping:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Run ping script
        run: |
          curl -X POST \
          https://<your-endpoint-url>/api/ping \
          -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
          -d '{}'
```

## üìù Logging

The project uses logging to track ping events and errors. Logs are stored in the Supabase database.

## üîí Security
